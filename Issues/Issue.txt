How to create a list within a list using HTML such that the validator doesn’t term it is an error? Is it allowed to use <ol> as child element of <ol> itself? Or similarly, how to properly use <ul> inside it’s parent element of <ol>? Internet search says it’s possible (which it is because I used it in coding this Project) but the validator says doing this will “suppress further errors from this subtree” and so doing this is an error. 

Why can't I put anything away if I am adding a link to it, in the html file? Why do I have to put everything in the same folder for the <a links> to work? Are links literally not meant to fetch stuff from ANYWHERE?

Why are the css classes required to be in the right order. How is the specifity affected by it? (Specificty decreases but why? The logic)
