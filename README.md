# odin-recipes
This is repository for the first ODIN project (Odin Recipes Website using HTML).
I haven't seen the exact things which this website will contain for now. This is because at the time of writing this text, I have not scrolled down to the bottom of Project Recipes Page on TOP. However, I expect to use:

 *Lists
 *Paragraphs
 *Multiple level Headlines
 *Images
 *Links
 
as I build this site. This is going to be awesome, so 
let's start!
